Katlynn was a retired lead geneticist of TuCorp and an avid gardener amateur fisherwoman at her home, respected by most in the field for her dilligence in research.
The day of the cataclysm, she was dreaming of a different reality, one housing many things she couldn't explain, with sky and plants of anomalous colors. Then, she woke up to the whole world around her destroyed, and her body now resembling a ferret.
She looked around at the ruins of her home, and she notices something: an odd page, in a language she never seen. And yet, looking at the page, she had a feeling like she could. She tried to read it, and words filled her mouth, like she was in a trance. When she was done, the page suddenly disappeared, and she felt the words now ingrained into her mind. 
Being a former woman of science, she was absolutely bewildered by all of this. Nothing made sense rationally to her, and she is curious to get to the bottom of this. 
She recited the words she memorised, and suddenly she felt herself being moved somewhere. In a blink of an eye, she found herself at the strange world she dreamt about. The Mind. Out of curiosity, she recited the words again, and now she'd be back in reality, back at the bed of her home. With newfound knowledge, she's now determined to explore the newfound wonders of both worlds.
