Once trapped in a cube and chained to a desk for what felt
like eternity, stuck doing paperwork, one day an
explosion goes off and Z3B4 is sent flying through space.
Some time later he gets intercepted by an abandoned spaceship.
The ship eventually lands on Earth, ravaged by a weird cataclysmic event.
He now explores this familiar yet different planet, in hope of finding an answer.
