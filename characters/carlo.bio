Before "that stange day", Carlo was a foreign exchange student in the local university.
While he was a good student grades-wise, he wasn't very social,
mostly sitting alone by the river to study or playing videogames by himself in his dorm room.
After the cataclysm he now works with the local settlement of Longese
(named after the local supermarket) as a door guard, though he REALLY
hates his job as that leaves him to cope with the situation alone,
the one time he feels the need talk to someone.
So one day he sneaks out of the settlement to assist some new friends he just met,
some that actually care
